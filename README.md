# 🎮 Retro Paddle Ball

A retro-style, multi-platform paddle ball game built in my spare time using **C++20** and **SDL3**, inspired by my kids and childhood memories.

> _"This is more than just a game—it's a story about passion, learning, and leadership in the age of AI."_

## 🕹️ About the Game

**Retro Paddle Ball** brings the timeless fun of paddle-and-ball mechanics into a sleek, modern engine that runs across:

- 🖥️ macOS (Intel & M1)
- 🪟 Windows
- 📱 Android (phones, tablets, TVs)
- 🕹️ Support for keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and touch

This is a personal project that started with my kids asking:
> *"Can you build a game like the ones we play on RetroArch?"*

The answer became a hands-on journey across graphics, physics, audio, input handling, screen resolution management, and cross-platform builds.

## ✨ Features

- Smooth ball physics and collision logic
- Multiple input support (touch, mouse, gamepad, keyboard)
- Resolution-agnostic layout (from phones to 80" TVs)
- Multi-display support (macOS & Windows)
- Retro-inspired sound effects and visuals
- Single-player and Two-player mode

🔮 Future Plans

While the current version is fully playable, I have many exciting ideas I’d love to explore when time permits.

🎮 Gameplay Features
	•	AI Paddle with adjustable difficulty (Using real human play data to train behavior, not just algorithmic reactions)
	•	Home network multiplayer (Play over Wi-Fi with friends or family)
	•	Power-ups & game modes (Timed challenges, survival mode, etc.)
	•	In-game settings (Custom paddles, sound controls, difficulty scaling)

🧠 Technical Improvements
	•	Improved game physics and collisions
	•	Game save
	•	Smart layout engine (Dynamically adapts score layout and HUD across screen shapes and DPI)

🖥️ Future Platform Support
	•	iOS (via SDL3 + Metal + touch support)
	•	Web (via WebAssembly) (Built successfully, but needs work to make it functional)

🧪 Engineering Deep Dives (in blog posts)
	•	Physics consistency across variable frame rates
	•	Input abstraction across devices (touch, gamepad, keyboard)
	•	Designing for 6” phones and 80” TVs with a single layout engine
	•	Lessons in perseverance, ambiguity, and shipping solo

💬 How soon I can build these depends on the time I can carve out between personal and professional responsibilities, and the complexity of some technical challenges along the way.

## ❓ FAQ

**Are you switching to gaming professionally?**  
No—this is a passion project, not a career pivot.

**Are you moving back to an IC role?**  
No—I love leading engineering teams. But building this reminded me how staying technical fuels leadership empathy and credibility.

**Did you use AI to build this?**  
Yes, I used modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, and sound generation engines. But AI isn’t magic—it accelerates, not replaces. Every creative leap still needed human thinking, judgment, and care.

## 👨‍👧 Why I Built This

I built this not just for fun—but to:

- Show that technical depth and leadership can coexist
- Inspire other engineers and parents to build things in their spare time
- Reconnect with the hands-on creativity that drew me to programming at 12

If you play it—even better, if your kids play it—I’d love your thoughts!

## 📬 Stay Tuned

I'll be publishing a few deep-dive articles soon on:
- The engineering behind multi-resolution support
- Game physics in SDL3
- Training AI paddles using real player data
- What this project taught me about engineering leadership
