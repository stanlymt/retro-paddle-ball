# 🎮 Retro Paddle Ball

A retro-style, multi-platform paddle ball game built in my spare time using **C++20** and **SDL3**, inspired by my kids and childhood memories.

> _"This is more than just a game—it's a story about passion, learning, and leadership in the age of AI."_

## 🕹️ About the Game

**Retro Paddle Ball** brings the timeless fun of paddle-and-ball mechanics into a sleek, modern engine that runs across:

- 🖥️ macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- 🪟 Windows
- 📱 Android (phones, tablets, TVs)
- 🕹️ Supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and touch

This is a personal project that started when my kids asked:
> *"Can you build a game like the ones we play on RetroArch?"*

The result: a journey through graphics, physics, audio, input handling, resolution scaling, and multi-platform deployment.

## ✨ Features

- Smooth ball physics and collision logic
- Multiple input types (touch, mouse, gamepad, keyboard)
- Resolution-agnostic layout (phones to 80" TVs)
- Multi-display support (macOS & Windows)
- Retro-inspired sound effects and visuals
- Single-player and Two-player support

## 🔮 Future Plans

While the current version is fully playable, I have several exciting features and improvements I'd love to explore as time permits.

### 🎮 Gameplay Features
- AI Paddle with adjustable difficulty (trained on real human play data)
- Home network multiplayer over Wi-Fi
- Power-ups & game modes (e.g. survival, timed challenges)
- In-game settings (custom paddles, difficulty, sound, etc.)
- Dynamic objects like bricks and collectibles for extra points

### 🧠 Technical Enhancements
- Enhanced physics and edge collision precision
- Game state saving and resuming
- Smart layout engine for adaptive UI across devices

### 🖥️ Platform Expansion
- iOS (via SDL3 + Metal backend)
- Web (via WebAssembly – builds successfully but needs polish)

### 🧪 Engineering Deep Dives (via blog posts)
- Frame rate–independent physics
- Input abstraction across devices
- Designing for both 6” phones and 80” TVs with a unified HUD engine
- Lessons in perseverance, ambiguity, and solo-shipping

> 💬 Timelines depend on spare time and complexity—but I'm excited to keep growing this.

## ❓ FAQ

**Are you switching to gaming professionally?**  
No—this is a passion project. I love the gaming domain but have no plans to pursue it full-time.

**Are you returning to an IC/technical role?**  
Not exactly. I’m deeply committed to engineering leadership, but staying hands-on sharpens my empathy and leadership judgment.

**Did you use AI to build this?**  
Yes—I used tools like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, and sound effect engines. But AI is not a silver bullet. It accelerates parts of the work, but creativity, quality, and engineering decisions still require deep human thought.
